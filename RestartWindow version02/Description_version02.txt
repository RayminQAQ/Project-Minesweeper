About the change in version02
  - Add multiple function in MainWainWindowGUI .cpp .h
  - Connect class MainWainWindowGUI slot and RestartWindowGUI signal in the RestartWindowGUI constructor

Problem: Need to merge into main

Note1: the main.cpp is for just debugging
Note2: this version can be a example of how to connect between class A and class B(which is in the B) - HARDEST PART
