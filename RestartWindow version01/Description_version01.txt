About the change in version01
  - Design the whole GUI framework, as MainWainWindowGUI .cpp .h
  - Design one of the window being used: RestartWindowGUI .cpp .h 
  - Constructor of RestartWindowGUI

Problem: can't find a way to pass parameter(ex: state) into constructor

Note: the main.cpp is for just debugging
