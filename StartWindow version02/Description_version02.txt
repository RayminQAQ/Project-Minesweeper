About the change in RestartWindow version02
  - Add and change multiple function in RestartWindow .cpp .h
  - No modificaation for MainWindowGUI
  - Connect object in the consturctor signal with class function

Problem: Need to merge into main

Note1: the main.cpp is for just debugging
Note2: the hide and show of the QComboBox is not done
  	- Idea: use onComboBoxIndexChanged to manipulate the hide and show of the hLayout
	- Idea: use hLayout->setEnabled(false) // Hide
